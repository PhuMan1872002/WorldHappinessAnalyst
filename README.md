# Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to happiness scores using various data preprocessing, analysis, and prediction techniques. Below are the key components of the project:

## Description

- Normalizing and cleaning data.
- Showing mean, **mode**, median in each column.
- Showing **correlation** between the Happiness score column and other columns to identify the factors with the highest impact on the Happiness score, utilizing the **K Mean** algorithm.
- Displaying necessary statistical charts for the entire dataset.
- Utilizing **Association Rule** to extract rules from the dataset.
- Employing **K Means** to automatically label the dataset.
- Using **KNN** to predict the dependency of GDP on Happiness Score.
- Comparing the predictions made by **KNN**, **Na√Øve Bayes**, and **Decision Tree** algorithms.

## Programming Language

**Python**

## Special Techniques

- Visualizing data using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.
- Data manipulation using **pandas** and **numpy** including reading data from CSV files, loading into dataframes, adding, updating, deleting columns, copying data between dataframes.
- Utilizing libraries such as **KMeans**, **KNN**, **Decision Tree**, and **Association Rule** for predictive modeling.
